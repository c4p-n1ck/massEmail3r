# massMail3r

A simple gmail client that can E-mail to a huge mass! (500 mail limit/24h/client.secret)

## Getting Started

Please refer to this for now: [simplegmail's getting-started](https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail#getting-started)

> **NOTE**: Do make sure that you've got `http://localhost:8080/` in one of your authorized `redirect_uris` for client OAUTH login to work, while creating a new credential. (manually writing the URL to `client_secret.json` will not work, you need to add it from the dashboard.)
